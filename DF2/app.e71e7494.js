As a student in Sweden, I was been taught for equality and human right. I graduated in 2016 and have been working for a IT startup a since 2016, i have been working with some EU projects and required to have business trips for job purpose. I hold a nursing degree and also completed Svenska som andraspråk 3. Now I am preparing for the Swedish nursing exam in November. My work permit is going to be expired in August 2018 and I have submitted my extension in June 2018. The waiting time shown in the statistics is 12-15 months. The long waiting period make me and my family feel extremely worry and mental stress. As I am not allow to leave Sweden for a year or might be more than a year. I can’t plan my trip back home for reunion or celebration. Home sick is a unbearable and my family wish to see me but I can’t promise to them when I can come back. I feel hopeless and powerless. Most of the time feel like leaving sweden as I feel my basic right as a skilled working immigrant is not well protected and neglected. I worked in (Country) for a year and I didn’t experience this kind of treatment and they process my work permit in a fast and professional way without such a long waiting period. I feel secure and welcomed by the country as they not restricted my movement in a long period as one year. One year is not a short waiting time, it means 12 months, 365 days and we are not allowed to leave the country otherwise we can’t continue to work and just waiting for a decision from migrationsverket. This is a way too long waiting time. As a health care professional, I have to say that my mental health has been affected to a large extend that I panic and has frequent arguments with family as they wish to meet me but I can’t promise when I can book the flight to back to my home country. Such an simple action, to book a flight ticket to visit family is not possible for an professional working adult. I lost my words to express how disappointed am I. I sincerely wish politicians and law makers can come out a more efficient processing system and migration policy for the work permit holders. At least to a compromise level that granting us work permit holders a temporary travel document while waiting for the decision for more than 2-3 months. Our voices deserved to be heard and our individual needs to visit our family and friends should not be neglected and denied. We came to Sweden because we love this country, a country full of nature beauty, good welfare system, gender equality and green environment. A more efficient migration system for work permit holders brings hopes and empowerment to the international skilled workers that wish to explore and contribute something to this beautiful country.

The information provided by migrationsveket is amazingly anmbiguos, so unclear and variant  specially for someone who does not undertood swedish.  While waiting for the outcome of the visa, you are trapped inside Sweden, you are threthened that you can go out,   but you can\'t go back in. I was told this by migratiosverket, so for couple of years could not go out of Sweden cause I was affraid of it, even when my dad passed away, I could not   go out. I even send a letter to migrationsverket asking to resolve my situation so that I could go to my dad\'s funeral and no response at all.   Then it got to the time to apply for my permanent residence, 6 months later,  the case officer tells me Im 2 months short  (which I disagree) so he approved the permit, but only with   2 months validity! So this case officer, instead of putting my case on hold, for 2 more months in order to ""fulfill the required time"" he decided on my case, gave me the 2 months temporary residence  forcing me to apply again after those 2 months, and send me to the very back of the queue!  No wonder they have so much workload with this kind of decisions! instead of being finished with my case  he just had another case officer handle it.  So I applied again, within a 2 months span, but at this point i feel so much unjustice and dispair, and I do want to go and visit my family. I really like sweden, but as they say,   doesnt matter if the jail is made out of gold, is still a jail.  So with the risk of loosing my job, and my permanent residence in sweden, I decided I want to visit my family while  they are alive, and not when they are dead. So Once more I called migrationsverket if it was ok for me to leave and come back while my case was still pending. They just said,   ""I cant either deny or confirm that you can go out and come back"" What kind of answer is that?     ",,1\r\n"After we got rejection, I had 1 month to leave, which meant that I had to sell my apartment and all furniture etc in one month, I had to quit from a  really good job that I worked hard to get.

I had several Friends that have been deported and several of Them got their citizenship in this period and we all were quite in THE same position Mv-vise. When we ask mv about this difference the replies we got were funny and they say that it differs to One Case officer to another. So thinking your life is under control of your case officer\'s mood and personal life issues in THE END have made me question life and innocance of People and of course how racism can find one even she/he tries to do everything in order and tries to adopt the community she/he lives in.

I feel discriminated because of this. I worked as cleaner while pregnant even doctor said that physical work is not good for my baby in womb just to hold and continue my visa.

Generally speaking I have good experiences with the ""Swedish system"" but migrationverket and skatteverket are simply the worst. Having to apply every year for VISA extension during my PhD and the usual long waiting time, without any possibilities of getting updates, are the worst part. Unfortunately, I had to cancel personal (worth 20000SEK) and professional trips due to being locked down in Sweden because of unexplained delays of 6 months to get my residence card.

A lot of the jobs I want and I can apply for after completing my education in the spring require citizenship here.  Therefore, a slow approval of my application (which is also pretty open and shut) hinders my integration and ability to be a fully-operating citizen.  There needs to be a balance between different departments and one cannot be completely neglected for the other and there needed to be a shift, not just a dismissal of people trying to lead lives, see family, even travel for family weddings and funerals.

It took them 8 months to reply to that letter and when they did, they said I had to leave the country if I wanted to apply through family . They stated about 3 times in one letter that if I tried to stay and submit my application here in Sweden, I would be deported and barred from coming to Sweden . At this point I hadn’t received an official “beslut” but th letter felt like a serious threat. That’s when me and my fiancé contacted the lawyer. The lawyer told me to write them back and ask them to revert to my job application because they didn’t inform me that they had moved the case from work permit to family ties. The lawyer wrote a letter asking them to revert to the previous application and if they decided to not grant my permit, then they should try the case using my family ties as ground. The lawyer also helped me compile a list of my ties in Sweden that would make it unfair for them to send me to my country despite having a full time job since, a fiancé, a company and with the new law that says that they have to look through cases as a whole not just month to month. After that I got another response from the immigration office asking me to send my offer of employment. I called the immigration office to ask if they didn’t know I was applying for work permit as I recall sending that document earlier.
